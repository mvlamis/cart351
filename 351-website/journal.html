                        <p>Although I wasn't yet enrolled in the course, I realized the value of this subject because it wasn't the management course that I had initially signed up for and attended instead. Thank the heavens.</p>

                        <p>The last time I used Python for anything was about two or three years ago, but I surprisingly hadn't forgotten much. With the syntax being relatively fresh and having learned JavaScript in the meantime, I was able to pick it back up quickly.</p>

                        <p>I've used dictionaries and web APIs in Python before, so this week was pretty straightforward for me. I was able to complete the exercise without much difficulty, and it refreshed my memory on how to work with JSON data.</p>

                        <p>Flask reminded me of the hellscape that was trying to figure out web hosting and deployment for some previous projects. I've never used Python for web development, so there was some new information that I learned about routing and templates.</p>

                        <p>Maybe Flask isn't my best friend, and that's ok! It might have just been because I haven't had class in three weeks but I'm not feeling so confident about it right now. It's not too dissimilar from other tools I've used so I was probably just using half my brain during class.</p>

                        <p>Big news: Flask and I have worked it out on the remix. Is jinja intuitive to me? No. But it works, and I can understand how to use it. I'm excited to work on my second project with it! I'm thinking about doing something more advanced with APIs and finding some library for visualization.</p>

                        <p>I'm pretty much settled in with Flask. I may have rushed the exercise today even though I didn't have to but at least that's one thing I don't have to do later. I'm not lazy I'm just stressed I swear</p>

                        <p>MongoDB is a stupid name and a stupid system. Why does everything need to have thirty different submenus. I miss Firebase, at least I could see what I was doing without being visually assaulted by the interface.</p>

                        <p>I'm still a MongoDB hater, so I'm glad we moved on to websockets. I can see how this could be used for some really cool real-time projects, and I'm excited to try it out myself. It was also really fun to see some other projects, especially since I need to start looking for inspiration for the next one.</p>
