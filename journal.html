					<h4> WEEK 1: SEPT 8th </h4>
					<article> Although I wasn't yet enrolled in the course, I realized the value of this subject because
						it wasn't the management course that I had initially signed up for and attended instead. Thank
						the heavens.</article>
				</section>

					<h4> WEEK 2: SEPT 15th </h4>
					<article> The last time I used Python for anything was about two or three years ago, but I
						surprisingly hadn't forgotten much. With the syntax being relatively fresh and having learned
						JavaScript in the meantime, I was able to pick it back up quickly.</article>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h4> WEEK 3: SEPT 22nd </h4>
					<article> I've used dictionaries and web APIs in Python before, so this week was pretty
						straightforward for me. I was able to complete the exercise without much difficulty, and it
						refreshed my memory on how to work with JSON data.</article>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4> WEEK 4: SEPT 29th </h4>
					<article> Flask reminded me of the hellscape that was trying to figure out web hosting and
						deployment for some previous projects. I've never used Python for web development, so there was
						some new information that I learned about routing and templates. </article>

					<h4> WEEK 5: OCT 6th </h4>
					<article> Strike... no class... no flask...</article>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4> WEEK 6: OCT 13th </h4>
					<article> Reading week... still no class... still no flask...</article>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4> WEEK 7: OCT 20th </h4>
					<article> Maybe Flask isn't my best friend, and that's ok! It might have just been because I haven't
						had class in three weeks but I'm not feeling so confident about it right now. It's not too
						dissimilar from other tools I've used so I was probably just using half my brain during class.
					</article>
					<h4> WEEK 8: OCT 27th </h4>
					<article> Big news: Flask and I have worked it out on the remix. Is jinja intuitive to me? No. But
						it works, and I can understand how to use it. I'm excited to work on my second project with it!
						I'm thinking about doing something more advanced with APIs and finding some library for
						visualization.
					</article>
					<h4> WEEK 9: NOV 3rd </h4>
					<article> I'm pretty much settled in with Flask. I may have rushed the exercise today even though I
						didn't have to but at least that's one thing I don't have to do later. I'm not lazy I'm just
						stressed I swear</article>
					<h4> WEEK 10: NOV 10th </h4>
					<article> MongoDB is a stupid name and a stupid system. Why does everything need to have thirty
						different submenus. I miss Firebase, at least I could see what I was doing without being
						visually assaulted by the interface.</article>
					<h4> WEEK 11: NOV 17th </h4>
					<article> I'm still a MongoDB hater, so I'm glad we moved on to websockets. I can see how this could
						be used for some really cool real-time projects, and I'm excited to try it out myself. It was
						also really fun to see some other projects, especially since I need to start looking for
						inspiration for the next one.</article>
