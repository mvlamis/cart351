For Project 3, we made something that neither of us can fully describe. It’s a social interactive art piece/game where users place a house in a virtual neighbourhood and can upgrade and customize it using virtual currency. We took inspiration from a variety of sources, including Club Penguin, The Incredibles, Tiny Tower, Webkinz, Mid-century modern design, as well as a mural that Mars stumbled upon while on the wrong floor in the MB building. ![C229AD08-7113-4701-B8C9-79D48E53ECD2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b5ef2bf-e90d-4ba2-96c9-806aa865c750)

Our idea was to take the general layout and visual aesthetic and add an interactive element by making each house node a different user of the site, so that the map itself looks the same for everyone but is still reflected by changes made on an individual level. On account creation, users would be able to choose from three house options to place on the map in whatever position they would be chronologically. Then, they could play games to earn coins, and spend them on furniture and house upgrades past the initial three options.

The workload was divided like this: Mars did the visuals including the interior and exterior of the houses, the furniture customization page, and the game(s), and Michael did the user account management, friends system, and page layout. 

The SVG icons are from [CSS.gg](http://CSS.gg), and I modified some [tutorial code from DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-flask-sqlalchemy-to-interact-with-databases-in-a-flask-application) for Flask-Login implementation because, as someone used to tools like Firebase that did the heavy lifting for you, I had no idea where to start adding authentication.

Hosting this was a huge challenge and I finally have a real justification for my hatred of Flask. After the debacle of trying to host Project 2 on PythonAnywhere, Railway, Render, and avoiding Vercel because of my personal vendetta against them, I resorted to using a hosting plan that I forgot I had with Namecheap. Surprisingly, this platform gave me the least trouble out of all of them, possibly because I’ve used it before, but never outside of pure HTML. Still, as of writing, it doesn’t work on HTTPS because the hosting platform seems to be allergic to SSL certificates unless they’re the ones selling them to you for an upcharge. Contrary to my previous resentment of MongoDB, it wasn’t terrible to work with other than its inability to play nice with the hosting platforms and their security rules. For example, I had to throw out PythonAnywhere because its free plan could only access a specific whitelist of popular domains, none of them being Michael Vlamis’s MongoDB Atlas Database For CART351. 

All of the assets for the project were hand drawn, which definitely added a lot more work than we initially anticipated. We didn’t just want the functionality to work; we wanted the aesthetics to really shine. Everything, from the houses, furniture, and home interiors to the mini-game icons, was designed to fit into a mid-century modern aesthetic with cute, simple graphics. There’s a lot of satisfaction in knowing that every visual element on the screen was carefully considered, and while it slowed us down at times, it was worth it to create a cohesive, charming look that feels playful but clean. The hand-drawn approach also gave us the freedom to experiment with shapes, colors, and textures, ensuring that even small details like shadows and rounded corners felt intentional.

For the village map itself, we wanted it to evolve organically as more users joined the system. The idea was that the map would evolve as more users joined, gradually populated with more homes over time.. On top of that, users start off with no money or furniture. This was intentional to encourage exploration and interaction. We wanted users to be motivated to try the games, earn coins, and slowly personalize their homes. It also made the reward loop clear and satisfying: the more effort you put in, the more the village reflects your activity. In this sense, the project serves both as a working experience and as a proof of concept that can be expanded with additional games, furniture options, and even more social features in the future.

We also paid close attention to the games themselves, making them easy to play while still being fun and rewarding. For example, in Whack-a-Slime, the goal was immediate and obvious, but it’s designed to feel lively and engaging, and the coin reward system ties directly into the home customization, which reinforces the loop. The matching card game similarly rewards exploration without the possibility of losing, so users can focus on the aesthetic satisfaction of seeing the cards flip and matching pairs. Balancing accessibility and reward was central to the design, we wanted the games to feel approachable while still giving users a sense of accomplishment.

Collaboration on this project was another highlight. We had worked together in the past and knew that both of us are extremely hard-working, which made the decision to team up again easy. We dedicated our last class period to planning in detail what the project would be. Initially, we divided the workload fairly and equally, but as the project evolved we didn’t stick rigidly to our plan, we adapted as needed and helped shoulder each other’s responsibilities. Mars focused on creating all the visuals, designing the games, and handling the home layout and customization system. Michael handled the base CSS, which was a big part of the overall aesthetic cohesion, as well as the shop, the village layout, and the friends system. The collaborative process was very iterative, and part of what made it work was being flexible and recognizing when one of us needed to take the lead in a particular area.
